        %p
          Lack of transportation creates barriers to essential services including unemployment, delayed care, unhealthy diets, and malnourishment. Neighborhoods with adequate access to transportation can better access amenities that connect residents to jobs, health care facilities, and other services.

          GOAL
        %p
          Establish pedestrian friendly and walkable neighborhoods by ensuring safe, equitable access to physical activity opportunities for people of all ages.

            Description: The Worcester Regional Transit Authority (WRTA) is a regional transit system that services the City of Worcester and the surrounding 37 communities in the Central Massachusetts area with a bus fleet that includes all-electric buses as well as many diesel-electric hybrid buses. The WRTA also provides paratransit service for the elderly and disabled, as well as a variety of special services for those groups in the entire service area.
          %p
            Charlton is the only community among the three participating towns with a WRTA Route (#29) that passes through the community. The route can be depicted in blue and travels along Route 20, Masonic Home Road, North Main St, and Route 169, before stopping in Southbridge. This route does not pick up or drop off on Route 20 due to safety concerns. This bus route connects to two other bus routes (#27 and #42) and provides access to a number of areas including: the Charlton Town Hall, Overlook Masonic Health Center in Charlton, Charlton Family Practice, Harrington Hospital Clinic in Charlton, and the Charlton Public Library.

          All roadways are in a constant state of deterioration because of time, weather, and traffic load. As a result, neighborhoods with inadequate road infrastructure and limited access to walkable streets present a major barrier to pedestrian activity and accessibility. This contributes to unhealthy, sedentary lifestyles, obesity rates, putting individuals at serious risk for chronic illnesses such as diabetes.
        %p
          GOAL
        %p
          Identify priority segments for pavement maintenance and/or repair to help support accessibility and mobility throughout Town.

            %p
              The key to having an efficient and effective pavement management program lies in the prioritization process. Pavement conditions along federal-aid eligible roadways within CMRPC region collected by CMRPC’s Transportation Division under the Traffic Counting Program. Priority segments can be used to inform decision makers choosing projects for the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) and Long-Range Transportation Plan. It also assists with pavement maintenance and determining the most cost-effective strategies to address the region’s deteriorating roadway conditions.
            %p
              The pavement in Charlton is overall in excellent to good condition (shown in blue and green lines). Excellent conditions were noted along Brookfield Road, as well as segments of Stafford Street, Dudley Road, Sturbridge Road, and Oxford Road. Good conditions were primarily noted within the northern half of town, along road segments on Masonic Home Road, route 20, and route 31. There are a few road segments towards Southbridge that are in fair or poor condition, particularly along route 169. Additionally, there is an area on the eastern boarder of Charlton and Oxford with a segment of roads in poor condition along route 20.

          Access to parks allows people to improve their health and wellness through interaction with nature and outdoor spaces. Physical activity opportunities (i.e. green exercise, personal and/or community gardening, and nature-based recreational activities) help combat overweight and obesity while promoting general wellness. Trees and vegetation can also help mitigate climate, air, and water pollution impacts on public health. However, fees for use of recreational facilities and activities, neighborhood safety, and access to walkable spaces continue to be major challenges to active living.

          GOAL

Livability is measured at the neighborhood level on a scale of 0 to 100, with higher values illustrating greater livability for people of all ages.

              Barre and Charlton received a score of 0.0, the same value as the average US neighborhood. This value indicates that the number of parks within a half-mile of neighborhoods is extremely limited or nonexistent.

          Insufficient physical activity is a risky behavior associated with overweight and obesity, which may lead to preventable chronic illnesses.

          Diet and body weight are directly linked to individual health status. According to Healthy People 2020, obesity is a major risk factor for high-cost, preventable chronic diseases such as hypertension, asthma, type II diabetes, heart disease, strokes, and some cancers. Weight gain also impacts mental health and wellbeing, which may increase the risk of stress, depression, social detachment, and suicide.

        %p      
          Limited access to and high costs of healthy foods are major barriers to active living for underserved groups such as low-income, minority, single-family households, elderly, and disabled populations. These individuals often live in food insecure locations that inhibit them from accessing local fruits and vegetables. As a result, alternative food options may result in unhealthy items found in gas stations, fast-food restaurants, and grocers. Although all Towns noted in the survey that the availability of nutritious/local produce was not a major barrier to healthy eating, there are still groups that are disproportionately affected due to high food costs and lack of transportation.
        %p
          GOAL
        %p
          Ensure all people in town have equal access to nutritious foods and produce by connecting local farmers to corner store initiatives, community gardens, and/or mobile grocers; and implement educational shopping/cooking programs in schools to encourage healthy food decision-making.

              The Modified Retail Food Environment Index (mRFEI) is a composite measurement of the retail food environment and represents the percentage of healthy food vendors located within a 0.5-mile buffer of a Census Tract. The mRFEI score indicates the number of healthy food retailers divided by the number of healthy and less healthy food retailers, providing an index score of the balance of healthy to non-healthy food resources. The lower the mRFEI score, the more convenience stores and fast food restaurants (and less healthy food resources) that are present in that area. CMRPC extracted the index scores for cities/towns within the CMRPC region to create this data layer.
            %p
              The Town of Charlton has an mRFEI index score of 9.09 for Census Tract 756102 reflective of a fair number of healthy food resources, when compared to the number of non-healthy food resources; Census Tract 756101 has a score of 0, indicative of no healthy food resources available in that tract.

              The data shows the locations of Farmers Markets and Winter Markets across Central Massachusetts, as provided by the Central Mass Grown, a community-based organization of farmers and buy local advocates. This data was adapted from the existing farmer’s market layer from MassGIS, and modified to include additional markets in the central mass region that were not part of the initial analysis. The markets are the only measurement of available healthy food options for this project.
            %p
              Charlton does not currently have any Farmer’s Markets that are regularly available. This is a barrier that prohibits residential access to locally grown and healthy foods and should become a priority in working to improve the healthy eating habits of residents.
