        %header
          %h3 WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?
        %p
          Lack of transportation creates barriers to essential services including unemployment, delayed care, unhealthy diets, and malnourishment. Neighborhoods with adequate access to transportation can better access amenities that connect residents to jobs, health care facilities, and other services.

                Description: This data is not yet available, however it is anticipated that this information will be collected as part of CMRPC’s regional bicycle and pedestrian planning and pavement management efforts.

          %h3 Pavement Conditions
        %header
          %h3 WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?
        %p
          All roadways are in a constant state of deterioration because of time, weather, and traffic load. As a result, neighborhoods with inadequate road infrastructure and limited access to walkable streets present a major barrier to pedestrian activity and accessibility. This contributes to unhealthy, sedentary lifestyles, obesity rates, putting individuals at serious risk for chronic illnesses such as diabetes.

          %h3
            GOAL

          Identify priority segments for pavement maintenance and/or repair to help support accessibility and mobility throughout Town.

                 Pavement Conditions along Federal-Aid Eligible Roadways
              %p
                The key to having an efficient and effective pavement management program lies in the prioritization process. Pavement conditions along federal-aid eligible roadways within CMRPC region collected by CMRPC’s Transportation Division under the Traffic Counting Program. Priority segments can be used to inform decision makers choosing projects for the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) and Long-Range Transportation Plan. It also assists with pavement maintenance and determining the most cost-effective strategies to address the region’s deteriorating roadway conditions.

                The pavement in Barre is overall in good to fair conditions (shown in green and purple lines). Fair conditions were noted along the southern half of town, along Route 32 and South Street, while segments in good condition were noted along West Street, South Street, and Summer Street. These areas contain transportation vulnerable populations, including senior citizens over 75 years of age and low-income households. Segments along School Street North, Route 67, and Wheelwright Road were found to be in poor condition. There are a several road segments in very poor condition, particularly nearby the Town Common on Williamsville Road, Mechanic Street, Exchange Street, and Pleasant Street

          %h3 Access to Parks
        %header
          %h3 WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?
        %p
          Access to parks allows people to improve their health and wellness through interaction with nature and outdoor spaces. Physical activity opportunities (i.e. green exercise, personal and/or community gardening, and nature-based recreational activities) help combat overweight and obesity while promoting general wellness. Trees and vegetation can also help mitigate climate, air, and water pollution impacts on public health. However, fees for use of recreational facilities and activities, neighborhood safety, and access to walkable spaces continue to be major challenges to active living.

                The Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) – Division of State Parks and Recreation (DSPR) Roads and Trails datalayer, , provided by Massachusetts Office of Geographic Information (MassGIS), contains all legal roads and trails identified by DCR staff and consultants on DCR DSPR properties.

                The trails in Barre are located within the Barre State Forest towards the southeastern part of town. In Blackstone, there is a concentration of public trails in the southern third of the town. These trails primarily include the Southern New England Trunkline Trail and trails within the Blackstone River and Canal Heritage Park, which crosses the border of Blackstone and Millville.
                In Charlton, there are no DCR Roads and Trails available to the public.

                 The protected and recreational open space datalayer, provided by Massachusetts Office of Geographic Information (MassGIS), contains the boundaries of conservation lands and outdoor recreational facilities in Massachusetts. 

                 The majority of open space in Barre is available with limited public access, particularly on the eastern part of town towards Rutland and Hubbardston which contains the Ware River Watershed. The Rutland Brook Wildlife Sanctuary is also an open space area with limited access, located on the northwestern part of town. Areas with full public access include the Barre Falls Project Area, the Barre State Forest, the Prince River Reserve, Racoon Hill, Moose Brook, and the Quabbin Regional High School area, which is available for recreational activities.

                  Number of Parks within Half-Mile
               %p
                 The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) Livability Index is a web-based tool created by the AARP Public Policy Institute used to track community livability across seven categories: housing, neighborhood, transportation, environment, engagement, and opportunity. Livability is measured at the neighborhood level on a scale of 0 to 100, with higher values illustrating greater livability for people of all ages.

                  Barre and Charlton received a score of 0.0, the same value as the average US neighborhood. This value indicates that the number of parks within a half-mile of neighborhoods is extremely limited or nonexistent.

          Insufficient physical activity is a risky behavior associated with overweight and obesity, which may lead to preventable chronic illnesses. The CDC reports that regular and adequate participation in physical activity offers a wide range of health benefits such as reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, weight control, strengthening of bones, and improved mental health.        %header

                 Walk Trips per Household
              %p
                Healthy transit options, such as walking and/or biking, provide residents with convenient, accessible, and low-cost alternatives to public transit and driving. Table 1 shows the number of estimated walk trips per household per day measured at the neighborhood scale by the AARP Livability Index.
                
                Blackstone and Charlton each have a value of 0.61, and Barre has a value of 0.55, which is approximately 10-18% less than the average US neighborhood. These scores indicate that these towns are somewhat walkable areas.

              %p
                Individuals who participate in regular physical activity and eat nutritious foods have a better quality of life and are less likely to develop preventable chronic illnesses. Table 2 represents the percent of adults lacking regular physical activity over a five-year average, as calculated by the BRFSS.
